image notes:
home page:
- for top down, no sky, try to make main ocean colour the same
- 2 diff cloud images? for layering and possible animating

project page:
- for waves, make the bottom part a constant colour (easy transition into bg colour)



NEW:
- change project cards so they aren't sticky (too buggy with formatting in different zooms)
